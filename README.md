This Application enables the user to send messages to the other users, where users can view their messages.
The application detects texts that infer a meeting invitation.
This is done by highlighting via hyperlinking any text that is detected as the possible appointment
And when the users click on that hyperlink, it displays a popup screen that pre-populates with the detected meeting details( when, who).
